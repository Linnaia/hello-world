# hello-world
Hello, you world I know barely anything about.

I am fairly new to this whole coding business, and the amount I still need to learn looms like a giant mountain in the distance. I know a fair amount of html and the beginnings of CSS, but don't ask me to write anything off of the top of my head because it would probably turn into one mungo bug! I need a ton of practice yet.

Sincerely, 
Ms. Butterbiscuit
